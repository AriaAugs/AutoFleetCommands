 afc_manage_fleet_automation_event_desc: "Choose what fleet/bombard stance your ships should use. This can be set individually for military, transport, construction, and science fleets/ships. For example, you can set your military fleets to use the aggressive fleet stance while your transport fleets use the evasive fleet stance.\n\nAutomation is applied at the start of every month and when closing this window.\n\nSelect \"disabled\" to manually control your fleet/bombardment stances. Disabling automation will not revert any changes made by fleet/bombardment stance automation."
