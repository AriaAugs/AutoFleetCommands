# AutoFleetCommands
Stellaris mod for automatically setting fleet stances and controlling colossi

## Description
This is a quality-of-life mod for Stellaris that automates fleet stances, planetary bombardment, and colossi orders. This mod works by adding three new edicts, "Fleet Automation", "Bombardment Automation", and "Colossus Automation". When any of these edicts are activated, the corresponding menu will be opened. From there, automation settings can be modified, including disabling fleet automation.

### Fleet Automation Features
 - Automatically set fleet stances for military fleets, transport fleets, science ships, construction ships, and colossi
 - Automatically set the bombardment stance of military fleets
 - Automatically send military fleets to bombard enemy planets
 - Automatically send colossi to destroy enemy planets

### Mod Limitation
Due to modding limitations, automated colossus orders CANNOT be manually canceled. Instead, you'll need to disable colossus automation to cancel any automated colossus orders.
